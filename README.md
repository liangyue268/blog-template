##Description

This is a ready to use blog template modified from [Clean Blog](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll).

Personally, I added the following functions.

* Changed background images which, for me, looks better.
* Added favicon, a little rocket.
* Added tags.
* Added comments section.
* Added archive.
* Added back to top button. Rock on!
* Added code highlight.
* Added 404 page
